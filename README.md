# WorkDay_Scheduler

## Description 

This application consists of a simple weekly calendar used to schedule events for the typical work day hours from 8am-5pm. Using Moment.js to set the current time, wherever this page is opened. Based on th current time which is displayed in the header and updated each minute by calling the API set to this page. 

When the user opens the webpage they will be displayed average workday time-blocks in which they can place tasks needed to be done for the week in the provided textbox with placeholders initiating "Tasks" in a faded grey color. 

Using Moment.js and jQuery, when the user views the page with the current time, they will be color coded. The textbox area is set for when the user is in the past, present or future times according to current time. For past tasks the textbox will turn a pastel purple, for present tasks it will display a pastel yellow, and for future tasks a pastel blue will be displayed. Making it very easy to tell which time it is. 

When the user clicks into the box to add a task, they can type any duties for the day and then when they press the save icon button for the time-block, the text is saved locally. When the user refreshes the page the tasks have been saved and persist ini the time block. This will allow someone to go back and edit and adjust tasks throughout the week.
